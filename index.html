            { question: "Interviewer: Hello, may I speak with Arel Abad?", answer: "You: Hello! Good morning. Yes, this is Arel speaking." },
            { question: "Interviewer: What position did you apply for?", answer: "You: I applied for the [Position Name]." },
            { question: "Interviewer: Can you tell me a little about yourself?", answer: "You: I’m Arel Abad, a BSIT graduate from CHMSU. I worked at Technopal Software for a year managing SQL, Linux configs, AnyDesk support, and Git/GitHub collaboration. I also interned at Trident Technology, focusing on UI prototyping and Canva, Photoshop, and Figma for personal projects." },
            
            // --- SALARY & CONTRIBUTION ---
            { question: "Interviewer: What are your salary expectations?", answer: "You: I’m looking for ₱15,000–₱18,000, but I’m open to negotiation depending on responsibilities and growth opportunities." },
            { question: "Interviewer: What can you contribute to the company?", answer: "You: I can offer my organizational skills, attention to detail, and strong willingness to learn. I may lack direct experience in social media, but I’m confident in adapting quickly." },
            { question: "Interviewer: Is there anything else you'd like to add?", answer: "You: I’m really interested in working here and committed to learning, adapting, and giving my best. I’m confident I can quickly pick up new skills." },
            { question: "Interviewer: If this position isn’t available, would you consider other roles?", answer: "You: Yes, I’m open to other roles where my skills can be useful." },

            // --- FOLLOW-UP & QUESTIONS ---
            { question: "Interviewer: Do you have any questions for me?", answer: "You: Yes, could you tell me more about the team I’d be working with and what a typical day looks like in this role?" },
            { question: "Interviewer: Where did you hear about this job?", answer: "You: I saw the job posting on online platforms like Indeed and Mynimo." },

            // --- RESIGNATION & REASONING ---
            { question: "What skills did you gain from your previous work?", answer: "You: In my previous role at Technopal Software, I was mainly focused on troubleshooting and handling client concerns, since the company has its own custom framework. Our main product was a school management system used by teachers and staff to manage student records, payments, and information.I often worked on resolving issues such as system errors, data discrepancies, or loading problems. This sometimes required me to directly update, insert, or modify data in the database — either on the cloud or by remotely accessing the client’s system through tools like AnyDesk.I was also trained to work with Java since there were times when we needed to add new features but my role was not fully focused on programming since our CEO handled most of the development. Additionally, I gained experience in installing web servers, deploying WAR files, and setting up Linux operating systems for client-side requirements." },
            { question: "Interviewer: Why did you resign from Technopal Software?", answer: "You: I appreciated my one-year experience at Technopal, but the informal processes limited my growth. I want to join a company with better structure, clearer goals, and opportunities for professional development." },

            // --- COMMON GENERAL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ---
            { question: "Tell me about yourself.", answer: "I’m Arel Abad, passionate about web development, UI design, and databases. I enjoy learning, growing, and solving technical challenges." },
            { question: "Why should we hire you?", answer: "I’m a fast learner, adaptable, and eager to contribute. My technical skills, dedication, and willingness to learn make me a strong fit." },
            { question: "What are your strengths?", answer: "Quick learner, detail-oriented, team player, and committed to improving my skills continuously." },
            { question: "What’s your weakness?", answer: "I get nervous presenting ideas, but I’ve been improving through consistent practice and preparation." },
            { question: "What are your career goals?", answer: "Short-term: Grow as a web developer. Long-term: Become a skilled full-stack developer and build meaningful projects." },
            { question: "How do you handle pressure or deadlines?", answer: "I break tasks into smaller steps, stay organized, and focus on priorities to meet deadlines." },
            { question: "How do you keep learning new skills?", answer: "I study tutorials, practice coding, explore tools, and work on projects to stay updated." }
